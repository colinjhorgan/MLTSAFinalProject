This folder contains the code used to create both KNN models and CNN models.

1. ModelingEval.ipynb contains the code used to train and evaluate KNN on all of our feature spaces, as well as the code which evaluates the results of cross validation for our CNN models. 
2. CNN_Model_Cart.ipynb contains the code used to train our CNN on raw timeseries using cartesian coordinates. 
3. CNN_Model_Spher.ipynb contains the code used to train our CNN on raw timeseries using polar coordinates.
