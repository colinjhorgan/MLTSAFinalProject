All Data Sources for the Final Project are saved in This repository.

The data sources for our feature spaces are indicated. FFT_features contains both spherical and cartesian features. Inputs to CNN generated using CNN preprocessing notebooks (See Preprocessing folder) are too large to download from google colab, but can be found in the 'Data' folder in the Shared project folder.

A further note on data in the shared project folder. Files which end in 'F' are obtained from CNN models trained using only 60 epochs. Files which do not are taken from our CNN model trained on 160 epochs.
